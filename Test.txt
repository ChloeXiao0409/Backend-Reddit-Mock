Black Box Testing
 -  send param, compare the result, you dont know what's inside
White Box Testing
    - you know the logic, write test for code itself


3 Types of Testing:
    - Unit test -> specific func only / if rely on other func -> need mock a Dependence
    - Integration test -> real relate together, no mock
    - end to end (E2E) -> simulate a real user behaviour (front to back)

jest -> auto test

test coverage -> fully cover all the happy path / edge case
